# Why code?


## Reproducible workflow

>Saves time,
>Produces better science,
>Creates more trusted research,
>Reduces the risk of errors, and
>Encourages collaboration.

![R logo](../img/R.jpg)

Base R

* a data science / statistics programming language

* built-in analytic functions



---

# packages

Packages extend the functionality of R

* statistical and data analysis

* data visualization

* data


---

![RStudio logo](../img/RStudio_400.png)


---


# RStudio

IDE (interactive development environment)

* also the company that developed and supports the IDE

* RStudio is also active creating and supporting packages, including...

# {tidyverse}

"The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."

The [{tidyverse} site](https://tidyverse.org): tidyverse.org

# An analogy...

Base R is like the engine and frame of a car

![VW Beetle frame](../img/VW_ad_1_crop.png)

---

..the packages are the other things that enhance the car's functions

...and RStudio is the dashboard and controls

EXAMPLES

astronomy

![galaxy density contours](../img/galaxy_density_contours.jpg)

???

http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/~ajrs/R/r-gallery.html

This shows the spatial distribution of galaxies in the cluster Abell 85, using data from the NASA Extragalactic Database (NED). Overlaid are contours of kernel-smoothed number density, plotted using alpha blending (semi-transparency). Also included is an inset plot of the 1 dimensional kernel-smoothed redshift distribution, with the same colours as used in the main plot, which also serves as a key for the colour-code; the dashed curve is a Gaussian distribution with the same mean and standard deviation as the galaxy redshifts

# RStudio Cloud

Web-based version of R & RStudio

[Link](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/34702/join?access_code=lr5keQ5WXcZ5ENNAZoLEAmPSQHav8seVNT2j36e%2F) (but will be invitation-only after today's class)

* later today, we'll run through the steps to install R on your own computer
